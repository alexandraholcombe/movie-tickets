# Movie Tickets Project

#### _Webpage to purchase Movie Tickets_

#### By _**Alexandra Holcombe && Marc Larkin**_

## Description

A webpage where a user can select the name of a movie, the time of day that they would like to see the movie, and their age.  The webpage will show the cost of the ticket based on these factors.  Non-"first-release" movies, matinee, and senior tickets will be cheaper than regular-priced tickets.
